Haskell Image Processing Library
================================

Haskell Image Processing (HIP) Library

Documentation is on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hip).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lehins/hip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lehins/hip)

Installation
------------

Install HIP using `cabal`:

* `$ cabal update && cabal install hip`

and using `stack` (from source code only, not yet on stackage):
* `$ stack install`

In order to be able to view images in GHCi and external image viewer is used. On
Linux I recommend `GPicView`, but you can use any viewer that accepts a filename
as an argument, so by default OS specific image viewer is used.
